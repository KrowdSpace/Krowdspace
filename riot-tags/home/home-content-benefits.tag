Projects are detached from their original platform branding, which removes backer bias and exposes them to a broader audience. As a project’s audience grows, the probability of reaching funding goals is increased. Pair that with Krowdspace’s effective <a href="#modal-boost" data-toggle="modal" class="modal-link home-links">project boosts</a> and campaigns gain momentum faster. Join the Krowdspace community today by discovering <a href="#modal-login" data-toggle="modal" class="modal-link home-links">new projects</a> or <a href="#modal-login" data-toggle="modal" class="modal-link home-links">submit your own project</a>.</p>

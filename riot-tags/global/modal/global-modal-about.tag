We had the great product, a full functioning website, personal story and a well crafted project page. It became very clear that we were missing one thing. Our community wasnt large enough and it was very difficulty to gain any traction. We searched high and low for a free or affordable website to show off our hard work and build our community but there was none.</p>

We had invested a lot of money into companies who promised promotions and news coverage or articles but never delivered. Our hard work and dreams had been taken advantage of by people looking to make a quick profit. The idea of a new and innovative company started to take shape to help others navigate the extreme world of crowdfunding.</p>

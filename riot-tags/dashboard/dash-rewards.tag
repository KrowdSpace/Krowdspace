            <div class="text-left">
                <p class="project-reward">For every project that is submitted to Krowdspace an exclusive reward will need to be provided for backers who support you through our platform. Krowdspace will look over each submission and the reward will need to be approved by our staff. This can take up to 24 hours. Make sure you can achieve these extra rewards when your project is successful. You will be obligated to fulfill any extra rewards listed on your Krowdspace project profile.</p>
                <p class="project-reward">One of the most common rewards is offering an extra 10%-20% off a backer’s tier pledge. You will need to make sure that it is clear for all backers to pledge a custom backing amount in the $1 "Thank You" area. They will need to put in the correct tier amount minus the 10%-20% you have chosen. Make sure to take into account your shipping costs. Another option would be to refund that 10%-20% on the tail end of your project after it has been completed. This is just an example amount and you can decide what reward amount or add-on you would like to offer. Here are some additional examples:
